This is a crustal shear wave velocity model in SW China down to 70km.

Format of model files of a total of 114 stations in SW China is as follows:

NAME

LON LAT

H(KM) VP(KM/S) VS(KM/S) RHO(GM/CC)

(P velocity and density are computed with the empirical relationship given by Brocher [2005].)

Note for myself: Station HLT and KMI have same location (possibly due to different time in which they are deployed) but slightly different RF and ZH ratio measurements.
